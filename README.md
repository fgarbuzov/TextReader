# TextReader

TextReader is a simple text viewer application that I created during my third year at university as a part of a course project. It is written in C and uses the Windows API for its GUI. The program allows users to view text files with basic features like moving the cursor and wrapping lines.

This project is not actively maintained and is presented "as-is." It reflects my learning process during my university years. Could be a bit buggy. There was another project where the GUI was implemented using Qt4, but I couldn't find it.
